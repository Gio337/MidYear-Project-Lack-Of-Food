                Our main problem in this economic society is lack of food and reasources in various countries. About 821 million people in the world – one in nine – do not have access to enough food. Some 795 million people in the world do not have enough food to lead a healthy active life. That's about one in nine people on earth. The vast majority of the world's hungry people live in developing countries, where 12.9 percent of the population is undernourished.

                The reason of why this is happening is because the gap of money the world is not making and natural disasters. Many people living in poverty simply do not have enough money to buy food due to factors like having children at a very young age. The scarcity of food is caused by economic, environmental and social factors such as crop failure, overpopulation and poor government policies are the main cause of food scarcity in most countries.

                One solution we plan to solve this problem is creating a worldwide donation. Our donations will help buy food and resources for the countries at sake. We plan to transport crates of food and resources that can last for a week and send crates weekly.
